Potatoes are a crucial staple crop worldwide, providing vital sustenance and economic benefits to countless communities.
However, diseases like Early Blight and Late Blight pose a significant threat to potato cultivation, leading to yield losses and economic hardships for farmers. 
To address this issue, we present a novel Potato Disease Classification System that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify potato leaf images as healthy, Early Blight, or Late Blight affected.

The dataset, consisting of 1000 RGB leaf images each for Early Blight and Late Blight, along with 154 images of healthy leaves, was utilized to train the CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
The data was preprocessed and converted into 32 batches of TensorFlow data, enabling efficient training. The resulting trained model is then integrated into a web-based application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
with Flask as the back-end framework. This user-friendly web interface empowers farmers and stakeholders to easily upload images of potato leaves and receive instant disease classification, facilitating early detection
and timely intervention.

Mitigating potato diseases is crucial for sustaining food security and supporting farmers' livelihoods. By promptly identifying and managing Early Blight and Late Blight, farmers can implement targeted treatment
strategies, reducing pesticide usage and minimizing crop losses. The AI-powered classification system and web platform offer a cost-effective and accessible solution to safeguard potato crops, ensuring a more resilient
and sustainable agricultural landscape for generations to come.
